This very generic approach do work pretty well! As long as your models (of the robot, its sensors, the world, etc.) do fit pretty well the reality for the given task, quite amazing results can be obtained. But being able to deal with incomplete models (and they always are incomplete!), being able to face unpredictable situations where all your models can no longer apply is still a very difficult task. One solution could consist in questioning the aforementioned perception architecture. One could indeed envisage a new way to deal with perception where this ability is no longer somewhat given a priori by the designer of the system, but instead built and discovered by the robot, not from the raw sensory signals (i.e. the outputs od its sensors), but from the sensorimotor flow (i.e. the data made of the data coming from extero and/or proprioceptive sensors, and of the commands of the joints).

This question is absolutely fundamental when trying to build robot with autonomy and adaptability capabilities, which are mandatory capabilities in modern application of Robotics.\n I chose to work on those topics through the sensorimotor contingencies theory, that explains that perceiving is analog to the discovering of stable relations (i.e. contingencies) linking motors and sensory events. Then characterizing these invariants (that is, determining precisely what they are and what are their properties) might help to investigate how internal representations built thanks to them could allow a robot to infer spatial structures without almost no a priori.

Recent developments definitely show that this is the way to go to develop an efficient audio system in Robotics; on the other hand, binaural approaches try to somewhat mimic the human auditory system, at least from an external point of view (two ears, generally with two external ears). Using only two ears in a Robotics context is still a very challenging task. But while one could question the choice to restrict ourself to only two ears, this is also a unique opportunity to test auditory models of human audition, and to stress the importance of action in the hearing process.  Indeed, hearing is rarely a purely static task. For instance, one often makes small head movements to disambiguate sound location, or better sound recognition.

Yet, when designing artificial binaural systems, this collaboration is often not honored. Instead, substantial effort is made to construct best performing purely auditory-scene-analysis systems, sometimes with goals and ambitions that reach beyond human capabilities. It is often not considered that, what enables us to perform so well in complex environments, is the ability of: (i) using more than one source of information, for instance, visual in addition to auditory one and, (ii) making assumptions about the objects to be perceived on the basis of a priori knowledge. In fact, the human capability of inferring information from one modality to another one helps substantially to efficiently analyze the complex environments that humans face everyday. Along this line of thinking, this chapter addresses the effects of attention reorientation triggered by audition. Accordingly, it discusses mechanisms that lead to appropriate motor reactions, such as head movements for putting our visual sensors toward an audiovisual object of interest. After presenting some of the neuronal foundations of multimodal integration and motor reactions linked to auditory-visual perception, some ideas and issues from the field of a robotics are tackled. This is accomplished by referring to computational modeling. Thereby some biological bases are discussed as underlie active multimodal perception, and it is demonstrated how these can be taken into account when designing artificial agents endowed with human-like perception.","tags":[],"title":"Audition as a Trigger for Head Movements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valentin Marcel","Sylvain Argentieri","Bruno Gas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578071859,"objectID":"d3e837983ba81c8fc3e291defea25ba4","permalink":"https://my.sylar.org/publication/2020j_where_do_i_move/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T21:47:45+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020j_where_do_i_move/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper deals with the perception of mobile robotic systems within the framework of interactive perception, and inspired by the sensorimotor contingencies (SMC) theory.

Being able to perceive and analyse an auditory scene has been identified about 20 years ago as one of the seven challenges faced by artificial intelligence in Robotics. It is today a scientific topic on its own, dealt with by multiple scientific Communities (Signal Processing, Acoustics, Robotics). While the Robot Audition community has been mainly focused on microphone array based approaches, exploiting only two microphones in a binaural setup is still a challenging task. The work presented in the first part of this dissertation deals with binaural audition, and is dedicated to sound source localization and active multimodal scene analysis in realistic robotics conditions involving noise and reverberations. The movement of the robotic plateform plays a fundamental role in these works: while causing changes in acoustic conditions, the robot action can also been exploited by closing the traditional perception/action loop to better the multimodal scene analysis. The second part of this dessertation is dedicated to a more formal approach to perception, where action can not be separated from perception anymore: perception is only possible by interacting on and with the environment. This interactive perception paradigm allows to study how a naive system is able to build by itself a representation of its interaction with its environmenent by discovering invariant structures inside its own sensorimotor flow. This formal approach could allow the robot to incrementally experience the notion of space, shared by the system and objects in the environment. Such a fundamental problematic has not been addressed specifically inside the audio modality, and aims at proposing a new sensorimotor framework to better understand the perception process that could allow Robotics system to gain in Autonomy.","tags":[],"title":"Un (petit) pas vers la perception interactive","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valentin Marcel","Sylvain Argentieri","Bruno Gas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1536566400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578071859,"objectID":"d1f6701016afeeb6de5defe316c1e4f1","permalink":"https://my.sylar.org/publication/2018w_where_do_i_move/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T18:03:06+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018w_where_do_i_move/","section":"publication","summary":"In autonomous robotics the question of the representation of the world is of crucial importance for the realization of complex tasks.

In the proposed formulation, each sound source is represented by means of spectral dictionaries, temporal activation, and its distribution within each channel (here, left and right ears). This distribution, being dependent on the frequency, can be interpreted as an explicit estimation of the Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) of a binaural head which can then be converted into the estimated sound source position. Moreover, the semisupervised formulation of the non-negative factorization allows us to integrate prior knowledge about some sound sources of interest whose dictionaries can be learned in advance, whereas the remaining sources are considered as background sound, which remains unknown and is estimated on the fly.

Ahead of consideration about objects or task spaces common in developmental robotics, this research is interested in the birth of the principle of space by a naive agent. It is only after having acquired this principle that it is possible to build the higher level paradigms such as the existence of objects or grasping tasks, etc. Indeed space existence is most of the time an a priori knowledge about the world which is brought by the engineer with the definition of models such as kinematics models or spatial state parameters. This work is based on the analysis of the so-called sensorimotor flow, particularly on the study of correlation and invariance in exteroceptive and proprioceptive signals, i.e. sensorimotor contingencies. Such contingencies carry fundamental structural information on the world. Poincar√© suggested that information about dimension of the space in which the agent movements are embedded, such as the 3D euclidean space of translation or possibly more complex spaces, can be extracted from the study of sensorimotor manifold. Later, studies have been proposed by Philipona et. al then by Laflaqui√®re et. al to extract this specific dimension. More recently, Laflaqui√®re et. al have shown that it was also possible to obtain an internal representation of the agent‚Äôs movements in a simple environment by the construction of specific motor partitions. The approach is an extension of the work from Laflaqui√®re et. al with a focus on self-interaction by the agent. Indeed, as pointed out by Frolov, self-interaction allows the agent not to make any prior hypothesis on environment stability as any sensation would be caused by the agent itself. From the use of sensory invariance and the construction of kernel sets, an internal, i.e. proprioceptive, representation of the self-touching interaction can be built. A first but incomplete solution have already been proposed which is completed in the present work. In the former, the internal representation is built to geometrically characterize the shape of the body, based on this, some contributions prove that it is also possible to use it as an internal representation of movements in space and as a basis for motor planning and particularly sensation reaching. This will allow a totally naive agent, with no knowledge on its structure or on the dimension of the space it is embedded in, to successfully predict self-interaction.","tags":[],"title":"Building and exploiting a sensorimotor representation of a naive agent self-interaction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin Cohen-Lhyver","Sylvain Argentieri","Bruno Gas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1473058800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578071859,"objectID":"6d4decf4193b1f17bd90a6f3c4a8dcf8","permalink":"https://my.sylar.org/publication/2016c_multimodal_fusion_and_inference_ica/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T17:45:08+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2016c_multimodal_fusion_and_inference_ica/","section":"publication","summary":"Hearing is a key modality on which several perceptual human processes rely on. Together with vision, these two modalities offer a 360 degrees wide, highly sensitive, quickly adaptive, and incredibly precise system of perception of the environment. In an exploratory robotics context, the concept of audiovisual objects is very relevant for a robot since it enables it to better understand its environment, and also to interact with it. However, how to face the cases when an object is out of sight, or when it does not emits sound, that is, the cases of missing information? The pro- posed Multimodal Fusion and Inference (MFI) system takes advantages of having (i) multimodal information and (ii) the ability to move in the environment, to implement a low-level attentional algorithm that enables a mobile robot to understand its environment in terms of audiovisual ob- jects. In the case of a missing modality, the proposed algorithm is able to infer the missing data thus providing to the robot full information to higher cognitive stages. The MFI system is based on an online and unsupervised learning algorithm using a modified self-organizing map. Furthermore, the MFI exploits the ability to turn the robot head towards objects, thus benefiting from active perception to reinforce autonomously what the system is actually learning.

DWmod is primarily based on auditory information, possibly coupled with visual data. These audiovisual characterizations rely on classification experts whose outputs are used by DWmod to trigger a SHM. The attention mechanism modeled by DWmod is rooted in the notion of congruence and predictability of items, allowing the robot to dynamically create its own rules about what is important or not in the current scene. This behavior is especially relevant in exploration tasks and particularly in search \u0026 rescue scenarios, where the robot has to react quickly with potentially no knowledge at all about the current environment.

This intuition has been proven incorrect with regard to a number of critical issues, such as visual change blindness. In order to develop truly autonomous robots, we must step away from this intuition and let robotic agents develop their own way of perceiving. The robot should start from scratch and gradually develop perceptual notions, under no prior assumptions, exclusively by looking into its sensorimotor experience and identifying repetitive patterns and invariants. One of the most fundamental perceptual notions, space, cannot be an exception to this requirement. In this paper we look into the prerequisites for the emergence of simplified spatial notions on the basis of a robot‚Äôs sensorimotor flow. We show that the notion of space as environment-independent cannot be deduced solely from exteroceptive information, which is highly variable and is mainly determined by the contents of the environment. The environment-independent definition of space can be approached by looking into the functions that link the motor commands to changes in exteroceptive inputs. In a sufficiently rich environment, the kernels of these functions correspond uniquely to the spatial configuration of the agent‚Äôs exteroceptors. We simulate a redundant robotic arm with a retina installed at its end-point and show how this agent can learn the configuration space of its retina. The resulting manifold has the topology of the Cartesian product of a plane and a circle, and corresponds to the planar position and orientation of the retina.","tags":[],"title":"Learning agents spatial configuration from sensorimotor invariants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boris Garcia","Mathieu Bernard","Sylvain Argentieri","Bruno Gas"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1410073200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578071859,"objectID":"c1bb480926b8ddd60c4875fc88774e01","permalink":"https://my.sylar.org/publication/2014c_sensorimotor_learning_sound_localization/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T17:33:30+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2014c_sensorimotor_learning_sound_localization/","section":"publication","summary":"In the context of robot perception, a new set of methods for self-supervised sensorimotor learning has emerged lately. These methods try to extract robot and environment configuration information from a set of sensorimotor cues, with no use of any a priori knowledge. This paper is concerned with such methods, in the context of binaural robot audition. An incremental algorithm is proposed, relying on an auditory evoked behavior which allows a robot to orient its head toward a sound source. During the learning process, this evoked behavior is used in order to gather auditive and proprioceptive data before and after the head has moved to face the sound source. An auditorimotor map can then be constructed. Thereafter, when the source plays again near a set of previously learned configurations, the robot can use the auditorimotor map to infer a motor command that would make it face the source. In other terms, the robot has learned from past sensorimotor experiences how to localize a sound source in the space of its own motor azimuths. In the present article, we offer an experimental validation of the evoked behavior and put to the test an offline version of the algorithm. The auditory evoked behavior implementation being sufficiently accurate, our results show a good localization performance using the learned auditorimotor map.","tags":[],"title":"Sensorimotor Learning of Sound Localization for an Autonomous Robot","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karim Youssef","Sylvain Argentieri","Jean-Luc Zarader"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1383462000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578071859,"objectID":"20ede4e90d5424110d9abb50552f4a5d","permalink":"https://my.sylar.org/publication/2013c_learning_based_approach/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T17:26:19+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2013c_learning_based_approach/","section":"publication","summary":"Sound source localization is an important feature designed and implemented on robots and intelligent systems.

In order to evaluate the proposed approach in realistic noisy conditions, an isotropic noise field is also computed and a precise definition of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in a binaural context is outlined.

A bootstrap particle filtering scheme is used to perform active localization, i.e. to infer source location by fusing the binaural perception with the sensor motor commands.

Since the pseudo-likelihood is discrete, it is fitted with a mixture of circular distributions in order to enhance its resolution. For the fitting task two mixtures are compared and evaluated, namely the mixture of von Mises and wrapped Cauchy distributions. Furthermore, a solution is presented for calculating the von Mises curvefitting with low uncertainty, since the direct implementation can quickly surpass double precision floating number representation. The performance of the filter is compared using both the raw and fitted pseudo-likelihoods on experiments recorded in an acoustically prepared room with ground-truth obtained from a motion capture system.

A decision system treats the results of all the networks and comes to a conclusion, which will be sent to pilot, airport command center (ACC), or fault tolerant system.","tags":[],"title":"Aircraft fault diagnosis and decision system based on improved artificial neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Karim Youssef","Sylvain Argentieri","Jean-Luc Zarader"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1332658800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578071859,"objectID":"016f8d178e5646e24381ad10eeffa79e","permalink":"https://my.sylar.org/publication/2012c_auditive_cues_and_vision/","publishdate":"2020-01-03T13:30:07+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2012c_auditive_cues_and_vision/","section":"publication","summary":"A fundamental task for a robotic audition system is sound source localization.

Classical binaural localization algorithms often rely on the following process: first, binaural cues are extracted from the left and right microphone/ear signals; next, a model is exploited to infer the possible localization of the sound source.

In order to avoid these last complicated steps, we propose in this paper an original multimodal sound source localization method. The relationship between binaural auditory cues and the position of the sound source to be located in an image is learned by a partially-connected neural network. This approach has a higher resolution and is less complex than state-of-the art techniques. Simulations and experimental results are shown, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Recent works, based on the sensorimotor contingencies theory, allow a simulated agent to extract the geometrical space dimensionality without any model of itself nor of the environment. In this paper, these results are validated using a more sophisticated auditive modality. The question of multimodality fusion is then addressed by fitting up the agent with vision.

However, its use in robotics is fairly recent in comparison to other exteroceptive sensing. Nevertheless, its complementarity to vision and its potentialities for Human-Robot Interaction have been widely acknowledged. Besides binaural approaches, array processing constitutes a relevant way to endow robots with audition. The idea is to exploit the redundancy of the data sensed by an array of microphones so as to design robust and efficient functions. Most contributions in robotics have been rooted in the Computational Auditory Scene Analysis (CASA) framework. This in turn has given rise to unexpected original requirements. To cite few, any solution must be easily embeddable (geometry and energy consumption), perform in real time, handle wideband signals (e.g. the human voice), and cope with noise and reverberations. In this context, LAAS-CNRS has developed an integrated auditory sensor named EAR (‚ÄúEmbedded Au- dition for Robotics‚Äù), on the basis of a linear array of eight microphones, a fully programmable acquisition board, a FPGA processing unit, and USB communication.

The auditory system provides the human with many informations on its acoustic environment. For instance, we are able to precisely localize the origin of a sound and interpret its meaning, so that it would be very difficult to do without these auditory cues in our dynamic and evolving world. Yet, mobile robotics has seldom integrated this auditory modality despite its compulsoriness in order to complete the informations delivered by other exteroceptive sensors such as cameras, laser range-finders or ultrasonic detectors. This doctoral thesis deals with the design of an artificial auditory system for sound source localization, composed of an array of 8 omnidirectional microphones and an aquisition/processing board. This problematics has already been studied in Signal Processing and Acoustics. However, the unusual embeddability and real-time constraints imposed by the robotics context limit the applicability of such methods to wideband signals such as human voice. After a thorough bibiliographical study of the approaches to localization proposed in Robotics, the synthesis of frequency-invariant beamformers is envisaged. An original solution is proposed, based on convex optimization and relying on the modal representation of antenna directivity patterns. Compared to classical methods, its resolution at low frequencies is enhanced, be the source in the farfield or in the nearfield, despite the small size of the array. These optimized beamformers are then exploited so as to compute an acoustic power map of the environment. The localization turns to be more precise than with conventional approaches, and can process wideband signals in the frequency range 400Hz-3kHz. Last, a recent beamspace extension of the high-resolution MUSIC method is assessed, which could cope with the robotics constraints.","tags":[],"title":"Conception d'un capteur sonore pour la localisation de source en robotique mobile","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sylvain Argentieri","Patrick Dan√©s","Philippe Sou√®res"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1160380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578071859,"objectID":"2c598343125e801e8ed14e2eb0280a34","permalink":"https://my.sylar.org/publication/2006c_modal_analysis/","publishdate":"2020-01-02T15:51:23+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2006c_modal_analysis/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper describes a broadband beampattern synthesis method for sound source localization in the nearfield or in the farfield of a mobile robot, with a small-size linear array.
